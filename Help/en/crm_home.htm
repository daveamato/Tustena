<font size="2"><b>CRM Help Page</b><br><br>The <b>CRM</b> menu is the heart of your CRM system, and is where information about your clients, companies, and leads will be collected and stored. It consists of the following submenus:</font>

		<td width="50%" style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
<font face="verdana,arial" size="2" color="#ff500"><b>Agenda</b></font><br>
This is your <b>personal calendar</b>. Here you will see reminders if you have activites due on that day as well as appointments, meetings and events. You can create new appointments, meetings and events (one-time or recurring) and check the availability of colleagues. You can also view the availability of an entire office at a glance. If you are given the rights, you can "clone user" which lets you see the entire calendar of (and make appointments for) other Tustena users.

		<td width="50%" style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
<font face="verdana,arial" size="2" color="#ff500"><b>Companies</b></font><font size="1"></font><br>
This is an <b>address book for all companies</b> that you have contact with. They can be clients, suppliers, competitors, etc. Within each company profile are tabs which show the "Contacts" (the people who work there), the "Activites" that you have made with them (class, emails, faxes, etc), the "Opportunities" they are part of, the "Purchases" they have made from your company, the "Documents" you want to attach to their profile, and the "Products" that they sell.

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width="50%" style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
<font face="verdana,arial" size="2" color="#ff500"><b>Contacts</b></font><br>
This is an <b>address book for all contacts</b> (individuals) that you know. They can be clients, suppliers, competitors, etc. Within each contact profile, there is a link to the Company for which they work, and there are tabs which show the "Activities" that you have made with them (class, emails, faxes, etc) and the "Documents" you attach to their profile.
		</td>
		<td width="50%" style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
<font face="verdana,arial" size="2" color="#ff500"><b>Leads</b></font><br>
This is an <b>address book for all prospective clients</b> that you have. Unlike the company or contact profiles, the lead profiles contain info about the person AND his or her company. We suggest that once this lead buys your product, you convert it into a Company and Contact, however this conversion can be done at any time in just one click. Within each lead profile, there are tabs which show the "Activities" that you have made with them.

	<tr>
		<td width="50%" style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
<font face="verdana,arial" size="2" color="#ff500"><b>Opportunities</b></font><br>
An opportunity is <b>a product or a group of products that you are proposing</b> at a certain time, in a certain region, or by a certain sales rep. EXAMPLES - real estate: each home they are selling is an opportunity, travel agents: each vacation package is an opportunity, insurance: each type of policy is an opportunity, and so on... In each opportunity profile, there are tabs which show which "Leads" & "Clients" are interested in it, "Activities" that you have made with them specifically in regard to this opportunity, the "Partners" affiliated with the opportunity as well as the "Competitors". There is also a tab for affiliated "Documents" which could be price lists and brochures. The main page of the opportunity is a summary of the products from your catalogue that these leads/clients are interested in and some forecasts for the revnue of this opportunity. The products listed at the bottom is a summary of all the of the various products in which the leads and clients of this opportunity are interested.
		</td>
		<td width="50%" style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
<font face="verdana,arial" size="2" color="#ff500"><b>Activities</b></font><br>
These are any phone calls, faxes, emails, visits, letters, memos, quotes <font size="1"><i>(Coming soon...)</i></font> or support issues that you have with any contact, company or lead (within or outside the context of an opportunity). <b>Activities are a way of keeping track of what you have done with a customer</b> and what you still need to do in the future (precise to the exact day, hour and minute). For example, if a lead says, "...We aren't interested now, but try again in 2 months...",  you can create an activity immediately which will remind you to call that client in 2 months. Activities can also be hierarchical so you can remember what activity spawned another. Your activities which are due today will appear on your home page as a "To do list" until you have selected "done" at the top of the activity page. Activities are also useful to keep track of billable visits and phone calls.
