Create groups in order to organize the users of Tustena. Groups are hierarchical therefore if Group B is dependent upon Group A, Group A can see all of the information visible by Group B, but Group B cannot see the information visible to Group A. Example of groups; Managers, Engineers, Designers, Sales, Temporary Workers etc. The default group "System administrators" is at the top of all groups.

Create offices if your company is divided into different physical locations such as Warehouse, Factory Floor etc. or if I has different functional offices such as Administration, Sales, Design, Production. Offices are for organizational purposes only hence they are not hierarchical.
