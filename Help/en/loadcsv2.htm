In this phase we see a brief sample of the data that will be imported, a table of associations, where the user needs to assign the corresponding fields. For example, in the user's source data, the field that indicates the Company name is called <b>Company</b>, therefore you will need to assign Tustena's field <b>Company Name</b> to the corresponding field <b>Company</b>,<br>
and so on for all of the fields of the source data.<br><br>
You can also define the controls on the importation of data to prevent insertion of duplicate data:<br>
If the checkbox next to each field is checked, Tustena will check for duplicates and will not import records when a duplicate is found already in the system. For example activating the control on the Company Name prevents the insertion or other companies with the same name. Once the association of fields is completed, you can continue with the importation.
