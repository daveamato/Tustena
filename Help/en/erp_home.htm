This quotation module is currently in BETA phase (Testing) and it will replace the quotes activities section already present in Tustena CRM. <br>
Quotes can be added, erased or edited. They also can be associated to a Lead, a contact or a company and relate them to more activities. Every line in the quote can be freely added or loaded from the products catalogue.
