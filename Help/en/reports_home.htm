On the reports page, you can <b>create customized reports</b> cross-referencing any of the data in your Tustena account. Simply name a new report, then click on the various fields you would like to include in the report. This is particularly convenient for creating mail merge documents for postal mass mailings using Microsoft Word. These reports can then be <b>viewed as HTML, or exported</b> as a variety of file types (.csv, .xml, .pdf, .rtf, .ado recordset).
