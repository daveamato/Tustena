Here you see a graphical analysis of the best-selling products. These data are taken from the invoices listed under client company profiles. Here you can <b>add new products to the catalogue or to search for existing products</b>. You must chose a category for each product you enter. The active/not active option for products is useful when you cease to sell a certain product but want to keep all the records related to the past sales activities for it. If a product is not active it cannot be added to opportunities, invoices, or quotes <font size="1"><i>coming soon...</i></font>
