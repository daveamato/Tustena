<font face="verdana,arial" size="2" color="#ff500"><b>Import Data</b></font><br>
Use this page to <b>import contact information</b> you have exported from another program (such as Microsoft Outlook). An import wizard will guide you through the steps to import contacts, companies or leads. There are also instructions on how to export your pre-existing data from several commonly used programs.
		</td>
		<td width="50%" style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
<font face="verdana,arial" size="2" color="#ff500"><b>Users</b></font><br>
This is where you can <b>add users and activate or disactivate their accounts</b>. Disactivation is useful if you have an employee who no longer works at your company. You can disactivate his/her account and add a new user without paying for more users since Tustena's fees are based on <i>activated</i> users, not total users. Also, you will retain all of the records and activities made by the disactivated users.

EXAMPLE: Group B should not be able to see or use the "Company Information" page of the ADMIN menu. Therefore, do not add Group B to the list of groups that can see the "Company Information" page.
