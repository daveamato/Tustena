<font size="2"><u>Groups</u></font><br>
This important menu is one of the first places you should visit in Tustena. Create groups in order to <b>organize the users of Tustena</b>. Groups are hierarchical therefore a group sees all of the information visible by the groups that depend on it, but the dependant groups cannot see the information visible to the groups it depends upon. EXAMPLE - GROUPS COULD BE; Managers, Engineers, Designers, Sales, Temporary Workers etc. <br><img valign="bottom" align="right" src="/help/images/people.gif">

<font size="2"><u>Offices</u></font><br>

<font size="2"><u>Users</u></font><br>
This is where you can <b>add users and activate or disactivate their accounts</b>. Disactivation is useful if you have an employee who no longer works at your company. You can disactivate his/her account and add a new user without paying for more users since Tustena's fees are based on <i>activated</i> users, not total users. Also, you will retain all of the records and activities made by the disactivated users.
