<b>NB</b>: If you are importing activites be sure to first import any applicable Companies, Contacts and or Leads first so that Tustena can make the cross-references between the records. If you do not indicate an "owner" for an activity it will be imported with the current user as the owner. If there is no co-related Company, Contact or Lead, Tustena cannot import the activity.
